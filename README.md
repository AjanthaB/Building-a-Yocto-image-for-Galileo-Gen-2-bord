# Building-a-Yocto-image-for-Galileo-Gen-2-bord
#####This tutorial will show you how to Building a Yocto image for Galileo Gen 2  bord using linux. And installing other packeges like OpenCV etc.
### Tested with Ubuntu 14.04
First of all you should install following packages

1. git
2. diffstat
3. textinfo
4. gawk
5. chrpath
6. file

If you are connecting through `proxy`, git requires proxy configuration.If any command fail, it may be proxy settings.You can find proxy settings here https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Working_Behind_a_Network_Proxy.

Download the file `FBoard_Support_Package_Sources_for_Intel_Quark_v1.1.0.7z` from here https://downloadcenter.intel.com/download/23197/Intel-Quark-BSP. And extract the file. you can see few .tar.gz  files, To build  this image extract the meta-clanton_v1.1.0-dirty.tar.gz file to new directory.
cd to meta-clanton_v1.1.0-dirty and run following command.
###### # ./setup.sh

When this scripts runs successfully, it will add additional folders such as bitbake,
meta-yocto, repo-ext, etc.

Next, `source the iot-devkit-init-build-env` command to initialize the Yocto
Project build environment. This command takes the build directory name as its
parameter:
###### # `source ./iot-devkit-init-build-env yocto_build`
yocto_build is the directoty name. use whatever you want.

After this command runs, the current directory will now be the directory specified in
the parameter (yocto_build in this case). From this directory, run `bitbake <target>` to build the root file system and kernel.

The SoC-specific `<target>` commands described below will determine whether the
resulting components are built for SPI flash or for SD/USB. The output is slightly
different for each target.

Note: It is not possible to perform both (SD/USB and SPI) build methods from the same
directory. If you want both builds, you must perform them on two completely
different and isolated directories.

###Build a Full-featured Linux for SD card or USB Stick

######Note:
A complete Yocto Project build can take several hours to complete, depending on your
internet connection speed and your machineâ€™s specifications.

To build out an image suitable for running on SD card or USB stick, the bitbake target
is image-full:
###### # `bitbake image-full`

When this process complete, the required output files are found in
./tmp/deploy/images/quark/ and include many components.

for image you should rename this files

1. `image-full-quark-some_number.rootfs.ext3` to `image-full-quark.ext3`
2. `core-image-minimal-initramfs-quark-some_number.rootfs.cpio.gz`  to  `core-image-minimal-initramfs-quark.cpio.gz`
3. `bzImage--3.8-r0-quark-some_number.bin` to `bzImage`

`some_number` means, after building this image some_number is equal to date this image was build  


copy this files to your SD card

1. image-full-quark.ext3
2. core-image-minimal-initramfs-quark.cpio.gz
3. bzImage
4. grub.efi
5. boot (directory)


Now you can boot image. This does not contained OpenCV packge.


### install OpenCV on build yocto_image using Intel Gelileo Gen 2

connect the Gelileo bord to your computer(with build os) and connect to ethernet.type following command ti install `OpenCV`
###### Galileo configuration instructions:

 To configure your Galileo to fetch packages from this repo, do the following:
 
1. login to os on the bord using `ssh` or `srial` (use the password as "root").

2. type this command  `vi /etc/opkg/base-feeds.conf`  with the following (other opkg config files don't need any changes):

3. add this links and save it

- `src/gz all http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/all`
- `src/gz edison http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/edison`
- `src/gz core2-32 http://repo.opkg.net/edison/repo/core2-32`

4. run this command `opkg update' (`don't use "opkg upgrade"`)

5. now you can install packages using this comand `opkb install <package name>`

to install OpenCV `opkg install opencv2` and also can see the packeges already installed `opkg list-packages`

now your task is ok.yiu can check OpenCV sucessfully installed or not inmporting the opencv2 to python
`import opencv2`
